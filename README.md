# AutoOrder

Allows the user to order from on demand from the command line while allowing the user to do anything but sitting down watching the loading circle of on demand spin while their food is being ordered. Uses selenium and python to navigate through OnDemand in a headless browser. 


## Inspiration

I developed this utility because of how time consuming it is currently to order food from ondemand and there needs to be a better method of doing so. This program is the first step towards creating that better method.
